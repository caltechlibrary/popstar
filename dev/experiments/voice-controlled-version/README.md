# Voice-controlled version of Popstar workflow

The first version of the workflow used voice recognition to interact with the user. It would ask the user for destination box and folder names, wait for the user to say they want to scan a document, etc. This interaction loop ended up being too slow, so we abandoned it and implemented the button-trigged approach currently used in Popstar.
