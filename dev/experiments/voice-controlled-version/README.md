# Voice-controlled version of Popstar workflow

The first version of the workflow used voice recognition to interact with the user. It would ask the user for destination box and folder names, wait for the user to say they want to scan a document, etc. After initially using this approach, we concluded that using buttons to trigger actions is preferable: it is faster that using computer-generated spoken prompts + voice recognition, and it allows the user to take as much time as they need in-between steps of the workflow (because the steps are performed on-demand by pressing a button). We abandoned the voice-activated approach and implemented the button-trigged approach currently used in Popstar.
