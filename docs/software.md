# Workflow software

The overall workflow is divided into a number of separate Shortcuts. Some of the Shortcuts – the primary actions in the scanning workflow – are meant to be invoked directly by the user; other Shortcuts act as helper modules used by the primary Shortcuts.


## Installation and configuration

The GitHub repository at https://github.com/caltechlibrary/popstar contains saved copies of the Shortcuts developed for Popstar.





### Prerequisites

The Shortcuts rely on a free third-party application, [Toolbox Pro](https://toolboxpro.app), that must be installed on the phone separately. It also currently requires the use of iCloud.


### Installing the Shortcuts

The Shortcuts cannot be imported from files directly into Shortcuts on an iPhone because the iOS Shortcuts app lacks a file import facility. Instead, to install the Shortcuts on an iPhone, one has to use one of two alternative approaches:

* Use a Mac: import them into the Shortcuts editor on a Mac, and rely on the automatic Shortcuts synchronization mechanism to let them appear on an iPhone after a short delay. This only works if the account on the iPhone is tied to the same account on the Mac where the shortcuts are imported.
* Use the iCloud-based Shortcuts sharing mechanism provided by Apple for the purpose of distributing Shortcuts. Clicking on the links on an iPhone will cause Shortcuts to ask the user if they want to install the shortcut, and (assuming the user agrees) will then install it.


### Configuring external button triggers for the Shortcuts


## Main workflow Shortcuts

The separation into separate software components offers the advantage that users can take as much time as they need in-between steps.


## Utility Shortcuts


## Shortcut triggers

We used an external wireless device to trigger the main workflow Shortcuts. This makes it possible for a user to operate the workflow with the device placed near them, instead of having to reach over and interact with the phone directly.
